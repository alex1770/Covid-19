,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. The estimates of percentage vaccinated are based on modelling of the people visited in the survey in a particular time period and then adjusted (post-stratified) to be representative of the population. However, these estimates may differ from other percentages given through administrative data due to a difference in the population denominator used to calculate the percentages, or any unadjusted for biases in our sample.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) administrative data is used to validate CIS self-reported records of vaccination for England.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. This analysis is based on statistical modelling conducted by our research partners at the University of Oxford.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. The method combines a statistical modelling approach with population information used in standard population weighting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. As this is based on Bayesian analysis, the appropriate uncertainty measure to use is credible intervals rather than confidence intervals. However they can be interpreted in the same way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. The England population used in this analysis relates to those aged 16 years and over living in private households.
